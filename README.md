The implementation of the paper: An Efficient Wild Bat Detection in Complex Scenes with YOLOv7 and Attention Mechanisms

The study of bat species and their distribution is vital for understanding the origins and transmission pathways of epidemic diseases. However, wild bat detection faces significant challenges due to their complex natural habitats and frequent occlusions caused by social behavior. To address these issues, we propose an efficient wild bat detection approach based on YOLOv7, termed WB-YOLO. This method integrates a Vision Transformer encoder module to improve global context integration, adopts deformable convolution, and optimizes the spatial pyramid pooling structure for effective multi-scale feature fusion while reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, a hybrid attention mechanism is introduced to capture both spatial and channel information, enhancing robustness in complex environments. Experimental results on a dataset of wild bat images collected in Anhui Province demonstrate that WB-YOLO achieves a precision of 90.7%, recall of 89.0%, and mAP of 94.7%, significantly outperforming other deep learning models in detecting bats in complex scenes and under occlusion. Our approach offers an efficient and accurate solution for real-time wild bat detection, with potential applications in ecological research and disease prevention.
